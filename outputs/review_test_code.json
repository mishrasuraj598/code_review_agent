        "Implement a 'Run After' configuration on the 'Send Email' action to handle potential failures. Log the error details to a designated location like a SharePoint list or send an alert email to an administrator.",
        "Use a variable or configuration setting to store the recipient email address. This allows for easy modification without changing the flow itself. Consider using a SharePoint list or other data source to store a list of recipients.",
        "Evaluate the sensitivity of the file path information. If it's considered sensitive, avoid including it in the email body.  Consider alternative approaches like providing a link to the file in SharePoint.",
        "Add comments within the workflow to explain the purpose of each action. This improves readability and maintainability. Consider using annotations or a separate documentation file for more detailed explanations."
