INSTRUCTIONS = """# **Power Automate Best Practices for Code Review:**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Naming Conventions**
- Use **clear, meaningful names** (e.g., `SendApprovalEmail`, not `action1`).  
- Follow **PascalCase** for flow names (`NewCustomerFlow`), and **camelCase** for variables (`var_userEmail`).  

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Structure & Organization**
- **Group related actions** using **Scope** (e.g., `Scope: File Operations`).  
- Keep flows **modular** and use **child flows** for reusability.  

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling**
- Implement **‚ÄúRun After‚Äù** settings for error handling.  
- Use **Try-Catch Scopes** to log errors and send alerts.  
- Store error logs in **SharePoint, Dataverse, or Log Analytics**.  

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization**
- **Filter data before loops** (use OData queries instead of iterating all items).  
- **Use parallel branches** for independent tasks.  
- **Minimize API calls** by selecting only required fields.  

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Access Control**
- Use **service accounts**, not personal accounts, for connections.  
- Restrict permissions to **least privilege access**.  
- Store sensitive data in **Azure Key Vault or environment variables**.  

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Version Control & Documentation**
- **Enable version history** and add meaningful commit messages.  
- Add **comments in actions** explaining logic.  
- Maintain detailed documentation in **SharePoint, OneNote, or Confluence**.  

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Code Efficiency**
- Use **expressions** instead of multiple actions (`'Hello ' & var_userName`).  
- Avoid redundant steps; consolidate where possible.  

This concise guide ensures **scalable, secure, and efficient** Power Automate workflows. üöÄ
